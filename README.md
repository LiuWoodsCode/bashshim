# BashShim
BashShim is a Linux/Darwin/BSD shell simulator. While it can be used as a shell, it's primary use is to be used as a fake shell for forms of agentic AI.
## So, is this the replacement to LiuOS?
No. At least not right now. LiuOS is more focused on being a simulation of an OS and not a full REPL.
